<h2>Overview</h2>
This repository contains a collection of VHDL projects and components I've created during my learning journey. It will also house future projects I develop to further my skills.

<h2>How to use</h2>
<h4>Feel free to use as many components from this repository as you like</h4>
You can clone the repo and have all of the components locally, so when wanting to use one of them you just import them into the proyect. Else you can just create the component files yourself and copy the code from here.

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<h4>Designed with the Digilent BASYS3 FPGA Board in Mind</h4>
Components that use I/O ports such as swithes, LEDs, etc..  have been designed specifically for the <a href="https://digilent.com/shop/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/">BASYS3 board</a>. If you intend to use these components with a different FPGA board, compatibility considerations may be necessary.
