This repository contains a collection of VHDL projects and components I've created during my learning journey. It will also house future projects I develop to further my skills.

Designed with the Digilent BASYS3 FPGA Board in Mind

All components have been designed specifically for the BASYS3 board (https://digilent.com/shop/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/). If you intend to use these components with a different FPGA board, compatibility considerations may be necessary.
